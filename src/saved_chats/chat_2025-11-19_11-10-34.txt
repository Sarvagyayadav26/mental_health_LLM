Assistant: **Summary:**  
Keeping hydrated by drinking water can help ease the physical symptoms of love‑related stress.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Carry a water bottle** – Keep it within reach so you can sip regularly, especially during emotional moments.  
2. **Set reminders** – Use a phone alarm or app to prompt you to drink a glass every hour.  
3. **Aim for 8 cups a day** – Adjust based on activity level, but try to meet this general target.  
4. **Add flavor if needed** – A splash of lemon or a few mint leaves can make water more inviting.  

**Why it matters:**  
When you’re under love stress, your body can feel tense and dehydrated. Adequate hydration supports brain function, mood regulation, and overall physical comfort, helping you feel more balanced while navigating emotional challenges.

If the stress feels overwhelming or persistent, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, counselor, or mental‑health professional for additional support.
