I don't have a solution yet. Try consulting a doctor until we find one.**Love stress** is just the feeling of pressure or worry that comes when you care a lot about someone—like a partner, a close friend, or a family member.  
It’s the emotional “tension” that shows up when you:

* **Want the best for them** – you’re anxious about their happiness or safety.  
* **Feel responsible** – you worry you’re not doing enough or that you’re making a mistake.  
* **Haven’t met their expectations** – you fear disappointing them or that they’ll leave you.  

So, love stress is the mix of excitement and nerves that can make you feel both happy and a little anxious at the same time. It’s a normal part of caring for someone deeply.
