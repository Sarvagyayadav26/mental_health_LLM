Assistant: **Summary:**  
Career anxiety can be managed by breaking it into manageable parts, planning alternatives, and starting with small, achievable tasks.  

**Actionable steps**  
1. **Identify what’s causing the anxiety** – think about specific career worries.  
2. **Split the situation into two verticals**:  
   - *What I can solve*  
   - *What if I don’t solve it* – plan for both scenarios. [career-studies.txt#section1]  
3. **Create a backup plan** – list alternative paths or backup options; remember you’re not limited to one choice. [career-studies.txt#section1]  
4. **Start with an easy task** – pick a small, realistic step you can complete; if too hard, lower the standard and try again. [career-studies.txt#section1]  
5. **Build momentum** – after completing the easy task, move on to slightly more challenging ones to build confidence and progress. [career-studies.txt#section1]  

If these steps don’t help or you feel overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental‑health professional for additional support.
